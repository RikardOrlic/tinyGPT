# tinyGPT
PyTorch implementation of GPT(Generative pretrained Transformer)


A thank you to Andrej Karpathy and his great <a href="https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY">lecture.</a>

Dependencies:

- pytorch

Sample of the generated text with a model trained on the tiny shakespeare dataset. The model was trained with the hyperparameters that are currently expressed in the main.py file.
At 3000 iterations the train loss is 1.2054 and the validation loss is 1.5124. After 3000 iterations the model starts overfitting and the validation loss starts diverging.

It shall be hasted but the morning of it!
What may is nothing; and start I, and in heir

In alive his began that doth power'd:
Nothing how it, to sand unnatural discent;
Northrown against that himself and pity itter.

And with the peever garlant than I be sounded.
They naked of these gentle took in this soul,
Bad off. Have you, revenued my stood lies. All hold,
In lose banished such a child promott.

But I'll have come into this envy's bowry.
